description: '"A novel set in late nineteenth-century London, Children of the Ghetto
  gave an inside look into an immigrant community that was almost as mysterious to
  the more established middle-class Jews of Britain as to the non-Jewish population,
  providing a compelling analysis of a generation caught between the ghetto and modern
  British life."--Goodreads.'
